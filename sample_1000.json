Social development and etiquette are also taught and emphasized. They learn social graces that will enable them to always feel comfortable, because they will know what to do and how to act in any social situation. They have the opportunity to meet and interact with people of all ages, economic levels, and different lifestyles. Most importantly, they build a lifetime of beautiful memories. In 1994, the Wendy's High School Heisman (WHSH) was created to honor high school student-athletes.

For buildings this is still a good idea, for IT commodities - hmmm...not so sure. The pace of innovation is extremely high wee see evidence of this in the cellular phone market where new handsets are being introduced almost every 8-9 months...at some point the cellular companies are going to offer you and me a \"Service\" agreement that incldues the handset and automatic upgrades when the next generation is available. Will it be slightly more expensive per month? - Yep...will it eliminate the concern and worry about migration to the latest greatest handset? Yep... You do see the handwriting on the wall - right? We are in a consumptive IT age, utilizing IT as a utility no different than the consumption method for electricity and water - do we really want to be in the business of data center (power plant) operations any longer? Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the next logical in technical innovation - are there issues to worry about? Of course, that's why you get paid the big bucks - make the system/services run with stability, predictability and with linear scalability, so the business can thrive. If you got this far in this summary - you see the future as we do - we should probably talk.

Ensuring your dog is on a healthy diet is her job. She studied Bio nutrition and is also a certified Ayurveda consultant. She has always propagated organic and vegetarian alternatives to doggie diets. Her journey with dog nutrition began at home when she brought home a Beagle called Ginger. Being a vegetarian herself, she also had Ginger on a vegetarian diet who lived to a healthy 16 years. Mirchi, a red Pomeranian who has been with Subhashree for 4 years now is also on a vegetarian diet. If she is not researching and educating good nutrition and healthy diet, she spends her down time answering questions at Purebred Breeders Customer Service. She also responds to Purebred Breeders complaints on obesity in dogs, diets for aging dogs and special diets for dogs with health conditions.

I’ve been involved in several projects ranging in discipline from mechanical design, electrical, and application engineering. Because I have been exposed to so many different facets of engineering projects I am keen to get my hands dirty in whatever task I’m working on. I’ve loved to solve problems since I was a kid, as my 3000-piece K’nex set can attest to, which I used to solve problems like building a humane mousetrap. I developed this problem-solving mindset throughout my education at UC Irvine and my masters at University of Sydney. Some more recent projects I’ve worked on vary in discipline and scope from designing an autonomous watercraft from the ground up to assembling and troubleshooting a nanosatellite using basic and advanced soldering techniques and data acquisition. I am currently working as a mold/tool design engineer in the San Francisco bay area.

Throughout my career, I have worked and been engaged both professionally and civically for agencies that provide service to vulnerable populations. I have had extensive executive leadership experience with various organizations that serve the elderly, adults and children with disabilities, and women and children of domestic violence. My notable civic involvement includes past and present memberships on Boards of Directors for the New York State Association of Area Agencies on Aging; Anne Arundel County Maryland Council of Community Services; various Rotary Clubs; and the Advisory Board of the Pennsylvania Association of Nonprofit Organizations Standards for Excellence Program. However, my experience as director of an adult day health center in Maryland and Director of Cattaraugus County’s Department of Aging solidified my passion for improving the quality of life and quality of care for the frail elderly. When offered the position as Program Officer for Total Senior Care, Inc. to operationalize New York State’s first rural PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly) in my home county, I knew I had found an opportunity where I could apply my education, my professional experience, and my network of contacts to make a difference in the lives of seniors and the options they have for long term care. In the years to come, it is my objective to continue to apply my skills and knowledge in nonprofit management and governance and my experience in managed long term care to achieve success in other civic and professional endeavors. As New York State moves forward with its Medicaid Redesign initiative, I hope to be instrumental in advancing comprehensive, accountable, and community-based care for the elderly and the disabled within the counties of Western New York.","headline":"Program Officer at Total Senior Care PACE","also_viewed":["http://www.linkedin.com/pub/betty-horning/72/334/a12","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-sheehan/5b/b87/462","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/paul-cameron/89/232/51b","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/timothy-hogues/62/673/39","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ann-feightner/98/b0a/472","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/susie-folts/87/ba4/285","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kathy-mcgowan/32/1b3/2a2","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rodney-mitchell/4a/998/83b","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mary-wynn/4a/27b/b42","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-chimera/2a/923/631"],"image_url":"http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/pub/image-u0qnd2CKS1LeTheK48UTgrC692txfHB130bTXE2KQCWjWo9130qT4ZsiwCAxB_5iHn9/ann-feightner.jpg","full_name":"Ann Feightner","skills":["Program Development","Nonprofits","Fundraising","Community Outreach","Grant Writing","Philanthropy","Board Development","Volunteer Management","Non-profit Administration","Program Management","Conflict Resolution","Research","Organizational Development","Leadership","Strategic Planning","Elder Care","Healthcare","Community Engagement","Medicaid"],"experience":[{"start":"September 2008","organization":[{"name":"Total Senior Care PACE","profile_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/total-senior-care?trk=ppro_cprof","details":"Nonprofit; 11-50 employees; Hospital & Health Care industry"}],"end":"Present","description":"Operating Officer for PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly), a managed long term care program serving Cattaraugus and Allegany Counties.","title":"Program Officer"},{"start":"March 2006","organization":[{"name":"Cattaraugus County Department of Aging","profile_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/cattaraugus-county?trk=ppro_cprof","details":"Government Agency; 501-1000 employees; Government Administration industry"}],"end":"September 2008","title":"Director"},{"start":"March 2002","organization":[{"name":"CARE for Children","profile_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/care-for-children?trk=ppro_cprof","details":"Nonprofit; 11-50 employees; Nonprofit Organization Management industry"}],"end":"March 2006","title":"Executive Director"},{"start":"April 1999","organization":[{"name":"The YWCA of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County","profile_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-ywca-of-annapolis-and-anne-arundel-county?trk=ppro_cprof","details":"Nonprofit; 51-200 employees; Nonprofit Organization Management industry"}],"end":"October 2001","title":"Director of Financial Development and Communications"},{"start":"April 1996","organization":[{"name":"Almost Family, Inc.","profile_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/almost-family-inc.?trk=ppro_cprof","details":"Public Company; 10,001+ employees; AFAM; Hospital & Health Care industry"}],"end":"April 1999","title":"Director"}],"education":[{"start":"1990","end":"1995","name":"State University of New York College at Buffalo","degrees":["MS","Human Services Administration"]},{"start":"1984","end":"1987","name":"State University of New York at Buffalo","degrees":["Bachelor of Science (BS)","Psychology"]},{"start":"1983","end":"1984","name":"State University of New York at Binghamton","degrees":["Psychology"]},{"degrees":["AA","Business Administraton"],"name":"Jamestown Community College"}],"organizations":[{"name":"Pfeiffer Nature Center"},{"name":"Health Foundation of Central and Western New York Health Leadership Fellows"}],"given_name":"Ann"}

There are many facets and compliance issues to consider, that can make even the most enthusiastic rule setter shudder. It is by far easier for a company to stick to the status quo, not veering too far left or right of the legal minimum. That is not how I roll. Creating unique and valued benefits that enhance your team's engagement and loyalty is key to retaining talent and a personal passion of mine. Background: The PTO policy at Chums is generous, allowing up to 48 - 200 hrs/year depending on years of completed service. This, in certain cases, is not sufficient for continued income protection, especially for those who make a life on a non-professional wage. To help, I implemented a policy to allow Chums' team memebers with PTO hours to spare to donate to a \"pool\" for those who had exhausted their own PTO balances and still needed time off to address a serious health issue. In brief, any full-time Chums employee, who has worked a minimum of one year, can apply to the over sight committee for donated PTO. The applicant must have a documented serious health condition requiring leave from work and have exhausted all paid leave prior to application. Fairly simple. Truth be told there are some lengthy accounting calculations to be done for each donation and receipt, however, the benefits to the recipient team members far outweigh any complicated calculations that have to made to keep our Controller happy. It takes effort to discern what is going to be meaningful and valuable to your particular team. In addition, it often creates more work for HR as offering something outside the box doesn't usually come with clear instructions. Don't let that stop you from asking the questions and doing the research. Creating benefits around what your team needs can increase your employee engagement and decrease turnover both which hit the bottom line...hard.","members":[{"url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view","full_name":"Jacki Arevalo"}],"title":"PTO Donation Policy"},{"date":"August 2014 to Present","description":"How to develop a wellness program for a company whose employees by and large live and breathe for the outdoors? Things that make you go hmmm. Since a large percentage of our employees exercise on a regular basis outside of work I decided to explore the notion of teamwork and engagement through exercising AT work. I conducted a cursory survey to establish interest and scheduled a once/week 7 am yoga class at our Salt Lake City office and 4 pm yoga class at our Hurricane manufacturing facility. Initially both classes yielded satisfactory attendance which, predictably, declined over time. In Salt Lake the issue was 7 am and in both locations another challenge was the pull of family and outside interests impinging on \"out-of-work\" time. Back to the drawing board. Another survey, this time conducted face to face with each of our 65 employees to see what they were really interested in and why. The why is crucial; it allowed me to address several needs with one initiative. For instance, in one of our departments- losing weight was an ultimate goal. I attacked this from several directions and really give our employees tools the easily employ on a daily basis. We changed 25% of the snacks in our break-room vending machine, we added \"Fresh Fruit Monday\" and I scheduled a yoga/pilates class at noon. The class is priced (free stuff has little perceived value) at $4.00/class, substantially below what outside studios charge, and offered a 10 class punch card available for $30.00. The punch card gets \"buy-in\" and a certain commitment from the employee to get their moneys worth. I will expanding the program slowly and strategically with frequent employee input, measuring the results and reporting back to both team and C-level management.","members":[{"url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view","full_name":"Jacki Arevalo"}],"title":"ChumsFit 2.0"}]}

I facilitated the centralization of the technology SOX testing program into the Technology Audit group. I led my team in the redesign of the SOX testing process to create high quality, consistent, repeatable, standardized testing procedures. Through synergies obtained by this standardization of similar testing requirements and procedures, my team’s work is now actively leveraged for financial statement audit testing for Key’s external auditors, internal audit reports, risk and control self assessments, and for additional external audit control reports. I provide regular status communications and reporting to Key Technology and Operations management, Financial Risk Governance (FRG), the Risk Review Group, and Ernst & Young (EY). I actively partner with Lines of Business (LOBs), Operational Audit teams, and FRG to identify and evaluate compensating operational controls and facilitate communications to external auditors and bank regulators. In order to ensure ITGC work will continue in the event of staffing interruptions, I have built a high performing, knowledgeable, and highly interchangeable team by providing regular leadership opportunities to team members to coordinate and lead specific audits and SOX testing areas. I drive the team to provide thorough and decisive conclusions that include root cause analysis. I designed processes and requirements for the implementation of technology SOX testing into the Archer/RSA GRC system.","title":"SVP, IT General Controls Audit and Testing Manager","start":"August 2010","duration":"(4 years 1 month)","organization":[{"name":"KeyBank","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/keybank","details":"Public Company; 10,001+ employees; KEY; Banking industry"}]},{"duration":"(7 years 5 months)","start":"April 2003","organization":[{"name":"KeyBank","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/keybank"}],"end":"August 2010","title":"Technology Risk Reviewer IV"},{"duration":"(1 year 5 months)","start":"December 2001","organization":[{"name":"KeyBank","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/keybank"}],"end":"April 2003","title":"Senior Project Manager"},{"duration":"(6 months)","start":"July 2001","organization":[{"name":"Alltech Consulting Services, Inc","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/alltech-consulting-services-inc"}],"end":"December 2001","title":"Project Manager"},{"duration":"(4 years)","start":"August 1997","organization":[{"name":"Keane","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/nttinnovationinstitute"}],"end":"July 2001","title":"Senior Consultant"},{"duration":"(1 year 3 months)","start":"June 1996","organization":[{"name":"Medical Mutual of Ohio","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/medical-mutual"}],"end":"August 1997","title":"Programmer"}],"headline":"ITGC Audit and Testing Manager at KeyBank","also_viewed":["http://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-stocker-cia-ccsa-lpq/9/741/114","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-murray-cpa-cia/19/592/105","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/melissa-m-jones/6/b60/965","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/melissa-musser-cpa-cisa/6/670/83","http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-vasas/12/835/57b","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/richard-l-manning/8/797/a3a","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jason-clark/0/a73/b5a","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/brian-drotleff/6/3ab/636","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/chris-luca/1/8a5/807","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bob-koszkalda/3/854/b43"],"image_url":"http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/pub/image-rhTV5t9w3glWWOslS-bss6xc5FgOeMaYpNTyg9MwAYTt_LIMdhT5WJoK3YU_7b56AP/lisa-hiwiller-cisa.jpg","given_name":"Lisa","full_name":"Lisa Hiwiller, CISA","skills":["SOX","Testing","Audit","Risk Assessment","Risk Mitigation","Compliance","IT Audit","Risk Management","Sarbanes-Oxley Act","Auditing","Security","Vendor Management","IT Management","Information Security","Process Improvement","Governance","Internal Audit","Analysis","Financial Risk","Management","Information Technology","Leadership","Enterprise Risk Management","Business Continuity","Operational Risk Management","Internal Controls"],"education":[{"start":"1992","end":"1996","name":"Westminster College (PA)","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/edu/westminster-college-%28pa%29-20141","degrees":["BS","Mathematics"]}]}

My desire is to mend Education and IT together so that one day I can teach the importance of technology and give back.","headline":"Resource Room Manager at Workforce1","also_viewed":["http://www.linkedin.com/pub/toshi-felton/24/26/b39","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/whitney-wooten/4b/8bb/229","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ashley-desroches/47/73a/778","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/vivian-hernandez/68/180/552","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jasmin-santiago/40/794/466","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/whitney-cato/44/507/100","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ria-george/8b/3a1/8b9","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/barbara-charles/79/3b5/822","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/brenda-rubio/33/41a/37b","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/whitney-wooten/44/652/63a","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/shanice-thomas/12/5a/54","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elizabeth-hunt/3/514/85","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ethan-richards/4/592/558","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/whitney-wooten/70/124/44b"],"image_url":"http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/pub/image-ub81B2FF4ZSiaYQk44b6ErF7bSZoorgph3b6mLAFTzox6iDpgb8680gz_z5xVHfBmUT/whitney-wooten.jpg","given_name":"Whitney","full_name":"Whitney Wooten","courses":[{"competencies":[{"name":"Cisco Networking Academy – IT Essentials curriculum (hardware, software, server and networking)"}],"title":"NPower Technology Service Corps"}],"education":[{"start":"2013","end":"2016","name":"DeVry College of New York","degrees":["Computer information systems","Computer Science"]},{"start":"2013","end":"2013","name":"NPower Technology Service Corps"},{"start":"2006","end":"2010","name":"John Bowne Highschool","degrees":["High School Diploma"]}]}

Currently I am working full time, but I am always open to new opportunities. For over ten years I’ve gained design experience through a variety of media: print, video & web. I have a BFA in graphic design and am skilled in the entire Adobe Creative Suite. I have worked on both team and individually based projects. In both cases I held myself and my team to very high standards. Being very organized and able to multi-task I am not afraid to take the lead on a project, but I am also not afraid to let someone else lead for the greater good.

Welcome to the world of the new global travel manager who can sit anywhere in the world, and make things happen. For D’Souza, the whole world is one big souk, one bustling, exciting marketplace. “I am able to offer my clients the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, China and India and the United States, right from New York City, that’s how connected I am globally with my affiliates around the world,” he says.

The biographical information and the statement reflect the person at the time of the creation of the portrait. Mostly military personnel are pictured but some civilians are also pictured. All have travelled from America to the theater of war in Iraq and/or Afghanistan. The portraits are not for sale and not done at any cost to the participants.

The automated transforms included encoding, transcoding to different formats, and trimming to 30-second samples. The distribution system was a custom HTTP server that allowed media owners to control which digital radio stations and online retailers had access to their media. The project used agile development methods to rapidly prototype in Python against constantly changing specifications, mainly because of its similarity to C++ and extreme flexibility. Bottlenecks--for instance, the HTTP server--were rewritten in C++ for speed and efficiency. For cost efficiency reasons, the core database was Oracle which fed multiple read-only MySQL databases in the web farm.
