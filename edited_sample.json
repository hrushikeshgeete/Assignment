For buildings this is still a good idea, for IT commodities - hmmm...not so sure. The pace of innovation is extremely high wee see evidence of this in the cellular phone market where new handsets are being introduced almost every 8-9 months...at some point the cellular companies are going to offer you and me a \"Service\" agreement that incldues the handset and automatic upgrades when the next generation is available. Will it be slightly more expensive per month? - Yep...will it eliminate the concern and worry about migration to the latest greatest handset? Yep... You do see the handwriting on the wall - right? We are in a consumptive IT age, utilizing IT as a utility no different than the consumption method for electricity and water - do we really want to be in the business of data center (power plant) operations any longer? Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the next logical in technical innovation - are there issues to worry about? Of course, that's why you get paid the big bucks - make the system/services run with stability, predictability and with linear scalability, so the business can thrive. If you got this far in this summary - you see the future as we do - we should probably talk.

I\u2019ve loved to solve problems since I was a kid, as my 3000-piece K\u2019nex set can attest to, which I used to solve problems like building a humane mousetrap. I developed this problem-solving mindset throughout my education at UC Irvine and my masters at University of Sydney. Some more recent projects I\u2019ve worked on vary in discipline and scope from designing an autonomous watercraft from the ground up to assembling and troubleshooting a nanosatellite using basic and advanced soldering techniques and data acquisition.

Throughout my career, I have worked and been engaged both professionally and civically for agencies that provide service to vulnerable populations. I have had extensive executive leadership experience with various organizations that serve the elderly, adults and children with disabilities, and women and children of domestic violence. My notable civic involvement includes past and present memberships on Boards of Directors for the New York State Association of Area Agencies on Aging; Anne Arundel County Maryland Council of Community Services; various Rotary Clubs; and the Advisory Board of the Pennsylvania Association of Nonprofit Organizations Standards for Excellence Program. However, my experience as director of an adult day health center in Maryland and Director of Cattaraugus County\u2019s Department of Aging solidified my passion for improving the quality of life and quality of care for the frail elderly. When offered the position as Program Officer for Total Senior Care, Inc. to operationalize New York State\u2019s first rural PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly) in my home county, I knew I had found an opportunity where I could apply my education, my professional experience, and my network of contacts to make a difference in the lives of seniors and the options they have for long term care. In the years to come, it is my objective to continue to apply my skills and knowledge in nonprofit management and governance and my experience in managed long term care to achieve success in other civic and professional endeavors. As New York State moves forward with its Medicaid Redesign initiative, I hope to be instrumental in advancing comprehensive, accountable, and community-based care for the elderly and the disabled within the counties of Western New York.", "url": "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ann-feightner/2a/750/14", "also_viewed": ["http://www.linkedin.com/pub/betty-horning/72/334/a12", "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-sheehan/5b/b87/462", "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/paul-cameron/89/232/51b", "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/timothy-hogues/62/673/39", "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ann-feightner/98/b0a/472", "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/susie-folts/87/ba4/285", "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kathy-mcgowan/32/1b3/2a2", "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rodney-mitchell/4a/998/83b", "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mary-wynn/4a/27b/b42", "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-chimera/2a/923/631"], "image_url": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/pub/image-u0qnd2CKS1LeTheK48UTgrC692txfHB130bTXE2KQCWjWo9130qT4ZsiwCAxB_5iHn9/ann-feightner.jpg", "experience": [{"start": "September 2008", "title": "Program Officer", "end": "Present", "description": "Operating Officer for PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly), a managed long term care program serving Cattaraugus and Allegany Counties.", "organization": [{"name": "Total Senior Care PACE", "profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/total-senior-care?trk=ppro_cprof", "details": "Nonprofit;

There are many facets and compliance issues to consider, that can make even the most enthusiastic rule setter shudder. It is by far easier for a company to stick to the status quo, not veering too far left or right of the legal minimum. That is not how I roll. Creating unique and valued benefits that enhance your team's engagement and loyalty is key to retaining talent and a personal passion of mine. Background: The PTO policy at Chums is generous, allowing up to 48 - 200 hrs/year depending on years of completed service. This, in certain cases, is not sufficient for continued income protection, especially for those who make a life on a non-professional wage. To help, I implemented a policy to allow Chums' team memebers with PTO hours to spare to donate to a \"pool\" for those who had exhausted their own PTO balances and still needed time off to address a serious health issue. In brief, any full-time Chums employee, who has worked a minimum of one year, can apply to the over sight committee for donated PTO. The applicant must have a documented serious health condition requiring leave from work and have exhausted all paid leave prior to application. Fairly simple. Truth be told there are some lengthy accounting calculations to be done for each donation and receipt, however, the benefits to the recipient team members far outweigh any complicated calculations that have to made to keep our Controller happy. It takes effort to discern what is going to be meaningful and valuable to your particular team. In addition, it often creates more work for HR as offering something outside the box doesn't usually come with clear instructions. Don't let that stop you from asking the questions and doing the research. Creating benefits around what your team needs can increase your employee engagement and decrease turnover both which hit the bottom line...hard.", "members": [{"url": "http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view", "full_name": "Jacki Arevalo"}], "title": "PTO Donation Policy"}, {"date": "August 2014 to Present", "description": "How to develop a wellness program for a company whose employees by and large live and breathe for the outdoors? Things that make you go hmmm. Since a large percentage of our employees exercise on a regular basis outside of work I decided to explore the notion of teamwork and engagement through exercising AT work. I conducted a cursory survey to establish interest and scheduled a once/week 7 am yoga class at our Salt Lake City office and 4 pm yoga class at our Hurricane manufacturing facility. Initially both classes yielded satisfactory attendance which, predictably, declined over time. In Salt Lake the issue was 7 am and in both locations another challenge was the pull of family and outside interests impinging on \"out-of-work\" time. Back to the drawing board. Another survey, this time conducted face to face with each of our 65 employees to see what they were really interested in and why. The why is crucial; it allowed me to address several needs with one initiative. For instance, in one of our departments- losing weight was an ultimate goal. I attacked this from several directions and really give our employees tools the easily employ on a daily basis. We changed 25% of the snacks in our break-room vending machine, we added \"Fresh Fruit Monday\" and I scheduled a yoga/pilates class at noon. The class is priced (free stuff has little perceived value) at $4.00/class, substantially below what outside studios charge, and offered a 10 class punch card available for $30.00. The punch card gets \"buy-in\" and a certain commitment from the employee to get their moneys worth. I will expanding the program slowly and strategically with frequent employee input, measuring the results and reporting back to both team and C-level management.", "members": [{"url":

hope and honor others. *Be sensitive to self and others by nurturing individual beliefs and practices. *Develop helping \u2013 trusting- caring relationships. *Promote and accept positive and negative feelings as you authentically listen to another\u2019s story. *Use creative scientific problem-solving methods for caring decision making. *Share teaching and learning that addresses the individual
